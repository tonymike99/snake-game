Nokia Snake

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a snake game. Use anything you need. Give it your own style. Share the link to the code in a public git repository along with a demo link where the project is hosted online.

Must-haves:

- The game board should be a 30x20 grid.
- The initial length of the snake should be 5.
- A user can control the direction of the snake with arrow keys.
- A food item should appear at a random position after 3 seconds. When the snake eats it, the length of the snake should increase by one. The score of the user should increase proportionately to how fast it is collected. Once collected, the food item should move to another random position on the board.
- If the food item is not collected within 50 seconds, it should move to another random position on the board.
- Display the current score and the best score at the top.
- If the snake collides with the walls or with its body, the game ends. Show an option to play again.

Good-to-have:

- Responsiveness (i.e. a good-looking and usable mobile view)
- Having meta tags for link previews
- Dark mode

Youâ€™ll be evaluated on:

- Logic and cleanliness of code
- The symmetry of design
- Reusable components
- Completeness of features
- Ability to comprehend and complete features on your own. Looking for thought leadership in the feature area
